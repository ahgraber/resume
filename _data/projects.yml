# MS Capstone Project
- project: Capstone Project - Natural Gas Forecasting & Segmentation
  role: Primary Data Scientist & Analyst
  duration: Q4 2018
  # url: "https://github.com/ahgraber/MSBAnCapstone"
  description: Worked with anonymized natural gas consumption data from PECO to generate improved customer segmentation; used the segmentation to develop improved short-term forecast models using weather as an external regressor in Python.

# Fedorov Algorithm with Constraints
- project: Fedorov Algorithm with Constraints
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: Q4 2018
  # url: "https://github.com/ahgraber/Fedorov"
  description: The Fedorov Algorithm is a way to iteratively identify a D-Efficient fractional factorial research design. We investigated updating the switching algorithm with penalized row- and column-constraints and developed a custom genetic algorithm as a time-efficient stochastic alternative.

- project: Will I Be Late? Predicting SEPTA delays
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: Q2 2018
  # url: "https://github.com/ahgraber/Will-I-Be-Late-"
  description: Predicted SEPTA lateness with 75% accuracy using ensemble (random forest, logistic regression, SVM, neural network, and naiÌˆve bayes) based on historic train data and weather information scraped from the DarkSky API.

# DOTA2 & PySpark
- project: Predicting DOTA2 match results using PySpark
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: Q2 2018
  # url: "https://github.com/ahgraber/DOTA2"
  description: Created scikit-learn pipeline in PySpark to predict outcomes of DOTA2 matches with approximately 68% accuracy using simple metrics available through the API.
